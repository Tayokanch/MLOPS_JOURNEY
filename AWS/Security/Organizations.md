# AWS ORGANIZATIONS

- `Organization` is a feature in AWS that helps us to manage **Multiple AWS ACCOUNTS** and we can Limit / Restrict what an AWS ACCOUNT can do with a feature called `Service Control Policies`


## Organizational Unit
- `OUs` allow us to group accounts with similar business or security requirements

- This is a feature that acts like a parent container to ***configure AWS ACCOUNTS*** and the great part about the use of Organizational Unit we can apply a `Service Control Policy` To The Organizational Unit and all of the account within the Organizational Unit will then inherit the same Service Control

- Organizational Units could be seen as the IAM of the to Manage `AWS ACCOUNTS` instead of `USER`
