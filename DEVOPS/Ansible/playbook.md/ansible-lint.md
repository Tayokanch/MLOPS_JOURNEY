# Ansible lint

`Ansible lint`: This is use to build a mechanism to ensure consistency and quality across all our playbooks. 
- Its also a command line tool that performs liniting on Ansible playbooks, roles and collections.
- It checks our code for potential errors, bugs, stylistic error, and suspicious constructs.
- its akin to having a seasoned Ansible mentor guiding us, providing valuable insights, and catching issues that might have slipped past our notice.
