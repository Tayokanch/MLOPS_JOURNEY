# SNIPPET GENERATOR

- This is use while creating `Pipelines Job` its use in creating script which can be easily used e.g you want to create a script for the pipeline to clone the git url from the main branch etc.

- Click on the `particular pipeline`, click on `configure`, under the `pipeline script`, click on `pipeline Systax`

- search for the tools you wanna create script for e.g git then follow the steps

- NOTE: The `Pipeline systax` only appears when we are using `pipeline script` and not with `pipeline SCM`
